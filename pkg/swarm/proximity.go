// Proximity returns the proximity order of the MSB distance between x and y
//
// The distance metric MSB(x, y) of two equal length byte sequences x an y is the
// value of the binary integer cast of the x^y, ie., x and y bitwise xor-ed.
// the binary cast is big endian: most significant bit first (=MSB).
//
// Proximity(x, y) is a discrete logarithmic scaling of the MSB distance.
// It is defined as the reverse rank of the integer part of the base 2
// logarithm of the distance.
// It is calculated by counting the number of common leading zeros in the (MSB)
// binary representation of the x^y.
//
// (0 farthest, 255 closest, 256 self)
